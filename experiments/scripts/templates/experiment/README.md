# Experiment Template

This is where we'll detail the experiment!
This will include:

- What we are testing with this expriment
- How we are testing it
- How to run (maybe, depending on other choices)

To get started with the experiment, edit config.sh to match your design, then start running the bash scripts starting with 00\_generate\_timing\_distributions.sh!
