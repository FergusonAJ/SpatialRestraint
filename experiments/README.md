# Experiments

Here we can give a brief overview of what each expriment was for / was looking at. 

That _should_ provide a decent directory if anyone is curious. 

To create a new experiment in your local repo, navigate to this directory and run the following: 
```
./create_experiment YYYY_MM_DD__experiment_name
```
Where YYYY\_MM\_DD is today's date and experiment\_name can be whatever you want!

This will create a new directory in this folder. 
To get started, navigate into it. 
Settings for this experiment can be changed via config.sh. 
To start running data, start by running
```
./00_generate_timing_distributions.sh
```
