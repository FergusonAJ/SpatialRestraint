# Introduction

This document serves as the supplemental material for our ALife 2021 conference submission "The Evolution of Cellular Restraint in Multicellular Organisms".

## Overview

The document is split into sections.
Each section can be accessed via the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. 
Sections mostly correspond to experiments (some that were discussed at length in the paper, others that were not).
As such, most sections follow the same formula: setup, plots, and then statistics. 

## Interactive web app 

To build intuition on how organisms fill, we created an interactive web app. 
The web app is available here: http://fergusonaj.com/webapps/primordium/
