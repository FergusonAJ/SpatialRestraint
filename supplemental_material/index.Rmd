# Introduction

This document serves as the supplemental material for our ALife 2021 conference submission "The Evolution of Cellular Restraint in Multicellular Organisms".

The document is split into sections.
Each section can be accessed via the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. 
Sections mostly correspond to experiments (some that were discussed at length in the paper, others that were not).
