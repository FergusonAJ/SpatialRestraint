# Introduction

This document serves as the supplemental material for the ALife 2021 conference submission "The Evolution of Cellular Restraint in Multicellular Organisms".

## Overview

The document is split into sections that are assessable via the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. 
Each section corresponds to an experiment (some that were discussed at length in the paper, others that were not included).
As such, each section follows the same formula: setup, plots, and statistics. 

## Interactive web app 

To build intuition on how organisms fill, we created an interactive web app, available here: http://fergusonaj.com/webapps/primordium/
